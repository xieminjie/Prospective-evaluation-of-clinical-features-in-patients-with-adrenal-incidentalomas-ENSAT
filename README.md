# Prospective-evaluation-of-clinical-features-in-patients-with-adrenal-incidentalomas-ENSAT
This is master graduate software development project, supervised by Prof. Richard Sinnott.

In this project, an android mobile application for determination of a clinical score for 
patients with adrenal incidentalomas is implemented. An adrenal tumours is any benign or 
malignant neoplasms of the arena gland, several of which are notable for their tendency to
overproduce endocrine hormones. This project is on the basis of requirements of 
ENS@T - CANCER project that has a particular focus on supporting medical research into 
adrenal tumours. ENS@T - CANCER project supports a complete virtual research environment 
(VRE) based on the idea of web-based disease registry.  The project contributed an android
mobile application for retrieving patient daily report and data visualisation for the further
research of adrenal tumours.
